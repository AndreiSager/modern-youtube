## Description

Modern YouTube is a YouTube clone with the goal to help me, Andrei Sager, practice using UI component libraries and APIs to create an application to test out my skills to see how I can improve it. Another reason for creating this project is because I am dissatisfied with the current UI design of YouTube 2023 as it feels old and decrepid to the evolving times.
